# Distributed Data-Parallel SGD on CIFAR-10 (PyTorch DDP)

Revised design from the report: synchronous data-parallel SGD using PyTorch DistributedDataParallel.
Model: ResNet-18
Dataset: CIFAR-10
Measures training time and speedup for N=1,2,4 workers.

Run in Colab or local: open the .ipynb and run all cells.
